# HPGA2TerrainRendering
Small application that showcases some terrain generation via a very simple flight simulator, for University Of Leeds HPG assignment 2.

# Part 1
Basic terrain, read from a greyscaled image
# Part 2
Flight sim with keyboard events, camera movement...
# Part 3
Height fields in compute shader
# Part 4
Binned terrain to avoid rendering the whole scene
# Part 5
Texture effects to add visual effects: skybox(es), stratified clouds, terrain texturing (blend/use various terrains based on height), water surfaces (maybe with reflections, refractions, waves)
